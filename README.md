# CheckXACT: Exact Equation Examiner

A Python GUI tool for checking the **exactness** and **homogeneity** of differential equations, built using [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).

## Features

- User-friendly GUI for inputting M(x, y) and N(x, y)
- Scientific button panel for easy equation entry
- Checks if the equation is **exact**
- Checks if the equation is **homogeneous** and determines its degree
- Progress bar to visualize processing

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install dependencies:
3. Save the script as `exact_checker.py`.
4. Run the script:


## Example Usage

- Enter your M(x, y) and N(x, y) expressions (e.g., `x**2 + y**2`, `2*x*y`).
- Use the scientific buttons to help build your expressions.
- Click "Check the Equation" to see if itâ€™s exact and/or homogeneous.
